# Google Map Auto Road Tracer

Google Map Auto Road Tracer is a Flutter application that leverages Google Maps and the Geolocator package to track and visualize a user's movement in real-time. As the user moves, the app automatically generates and updates a polyline on the map, effectively tracing the path or road taken by the user.
